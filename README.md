# Tasks
## [ELF Parser](Elf_parser)
This C program parses an ELF file and prints its header information similar to the `readelf -h` command. It reads the ELF header and displays various fields such as type, machine, version, entry point, and more.

## [LQ_SHELL](LQ_SHELL)

This is a basic shell implementation in C with memory optimization designed to execute internal and external commands. It supports several built-in commands and can handle executing external programs.

## [Heap Memory Manager Projects](https://github.com/Belal0066/Heap-Memory-Manager/blob/main/README.md)

Two projects focused on managing heap memory in C: a simulation of a Heap Memory Manager (HMM) and a custom HMM Library. These projects demonstrate low-level memory management concepts, including dynamic memory allocation, deallocation, and fragmentation management.

## [fdskL](fdisk_l)

A command-line utility for displaying partition information on disk devices. This tool supports both MBR (Master Boot Record) and GPT (GUID Partition Table) partition schemes and provides detailed information about each partition.
